Forest World Scenarios

Your party is stopped by a group of masked individuals. You notice they are carrying blood stained swords and daggers. 
The largest one begins to speak
“ Hand over X gold if you know what’s good for you. Otherwise we might have some problems” 
He begins to point his sword in your direction.
Pay the gold
“Good choice. With smarts like yours you might get to live a little longer. HEH HEH HEH.” scenario ends
    2)  Attack the bandits
“Looks like these chumps got a death wish. Well boys, I guess we’ll just have to oblige them.” Start combat
    3) Run away
You try to make a break for it. As you attempt to drive past them, you notice a trip wire placed between a pair of trees.

	2)				Wounded knight
		On the side of the road you notice a knight lying down against a tree. 
His armour is dented, and what little skin you see is bruised. He notices you approaching begins to speak
“Greetings kind travelers, my name is Ser Galvin. As you can see, I am in need of assistance. 
This forest is quite dangerous, filled with some ungodly creatures.
 I barely managed to escape the clutches of one of these beasts.
 However, without medical aid I would be in mortal danger. I humbly request the use of any medical potions that you can spare.”
1) Give him medical potion
“Thank you. It’s nice to know that not everyone in this world is corrupted by greed. 
I wish you great favour in battle.” scenario ends
      2)   Refuse to give him aid
	“I understand. It’s unreasonable to expect to receive charity from those you have just met.
 I suppose I’ll just have to find another way out of this situation.” scenario ends
      3)   Kill Ser Galvin and rob him
	You reach into your pocket and take out your dagger and stab Ser Galvin in his throat.

 I refuse to have you leave empty handed this time.” Ser Galvin begins to take off his necklaces 
“Here, accept this as a token of my appreciation. It is a rosary created in service of my god. 
It is said to bring good favor to its wearer. Surely there must be some truth to that, as it has led you to my aid.”

 4) 						Fight Club
	The group comes across a crowd of people gathering around in a circle and meet a flamboyant announcer who is casting a fight. Upon seeing the group, he insists that they join the fight club (you can’t refuse). After you beat your first opponent, you can choose whether or not to keep fighting increasingly more difficult opponents up to 3 times. You can leave the fight club early, but you will get no rewards, and the announcer will make fun of you for being a coward, with the crowd booing you. If you beat everyone, you become the champion of the fight club and receive a huge reward.

5)						The Painter
	The group sees a painter who is sitting on a stool with 3 easels with paintings on them. The painter is a very cheery person, who would look like a colorful Willy Wonka type. He will say that he is giving out one of his paintings. The first painting is of a lion, the second painting would have a family of Ogres and the last painting would have a strangely colored potion on it.
Whichever choice you pick, the painter will vomit up a bunch of different colored ink, that would slowly form into a real version of whichever painting you picked. If you pick the lion, you will have to fight the lion. If you pick the Ogre family, you can either fight them or attempt to reason with them (although they would be very stupid). If you pick the potion, you will randomly get a buff or debuff for the next few fights. 
You can also refuse to take any of the paintings, but the painter will insist that you take one. You can continue to refuse, which would lead to the painter getting more and more angry with you, with him being insulted that you won’t even take his art for free. You can continue to refuse him up to 3 times. On the final time he will get angry with you and leave. Any future interactions that you will have with him will be more antagonistic if you refuse to take any paintings. If you take a painting he will be more cheerful in future encounters.

6)						Gambling 
	You come across a tiny man wearing a black suit with a big nose and a top hat standing next to a spinner. He will offer you the chance to spin the wheel for a chance to get a prize if you give him whatever the currency value is in the game (health potions, money food or whatever).
There will be 5 options, 1 jackpot, 2 options where you break even and 2 options where you get nothing. However the spinner is pretty rigged and the actually chances that you roll on the jackpot would be like 5 or 10 %. The player can continue to spin the wheel for as long as they want if they have enough currency to keep spinning. They can also stop spinning whenever they want or refuse to spin at all.

7)						The Magician
	The group comes across a magician who visually looks like a stereotypical magician that you would see at parties for kids. He will insist that he is the greatest warrior of all time and wants to prove it by fighting the group. The fight would be pretty easy, but he would have alot of abilities that would just annoy the player (abilities that would make it harder to hit him/ the ability to make illusions of himself). Once you beat him, he will clap his hands and smoke would appear, causing him to get away. He would serve as the rival type character that you would fight in each world, with him getting more powerful each time.
